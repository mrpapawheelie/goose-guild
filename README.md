## 🧵 Goose Guild Builder Cohort — Program Summary

### ⚡ TL;DR

This is a two-week, NFT-gated cohort for training 10-30 participants to launch fully structured, fair-launch tokens using Goose.run and Maverick Protocol.

- Participants pay 0.1 ETH to mint a **soulbound NFT**
- 75% of revenue → Buy pressure for $GGG (Goose Guild Graduate Token)
- 25% + creator rewards → Credexium ops funding
- Builders are trained on branding, deployment, lending, voting, and marketing using Goose
- Winners ranked by **market cap** + **fees generated**
- Graduates receive badge NFTs + are eligible to lead future cohorts

> 🧠 The Goose Guild cohort creates a structured, social, and onchain-native pathway for onboarding creators into the Goose and Maverick ecosystems — with **no dev lift, no upfront budget**, and **direct fee/revenue benefits** to the protocol. The program will incorporate a reward token that has a 2% buy fee and 6% sell fee in an effort to boost fees on Goose and provide some additional rewards to participants now. Participants will leverage Bankrbot on X and Farcaster to airdrop tokens for additional social exposure and something to add in a case study. We will track the wallets used for this to see how it enhances the usage on Goose.
