## 🧵 Goose Guild Builder Cohort — Program Summary

### 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Goose.run and Maverick Protocol represent a novel approach to fair launch token systems that goes beyond traditional platforms by incorporating:

- **Governance-Driven Fee Incentives**: Epoch-based voting on fee structures
- **Collateralized Memecoins**: Ability to borrow against your token
- **Advanced Protocol Mechanics**: Complex features that require specialized knowledge

This complexity creates a significant barrier to entry for creators and builders who want to leverage these powerful features. While the platform offers unprecedented capabilities, the learning curve and lack of structured guidance make it challenging for new participants to fully utilize these tools.

### 💡 Our Solution

The Goose Guild addresses this challenge through a comprehensive, two-pronged approach:

1. **Continuous Cohort Program** (10-30 participants per cohort)
   - Structured, social learning environment
   - Hands-on experience with all platform features
   - Certification of skills and accomplishments
   - Direct rewards and recognition for top performers
   - Exclusive access to Goose Guild Graduate Group upon completion

2. **Open-Source Template System**
   - Step-by-step GitHub template for token creation
   - Comprehensive documentation and best practices
   - Forkable repository for independent builders
   - Community-driven improvements and updates

This dual approach creates a pathway for:
- **Aspiring Consultants**: Build expertise in fair launch token systems
- **Platform Power Users**: Master advanced protocol features
- **Independent Builders**: Access structured guidance without formal training
- **Protocol Growth**: Increase platform adoption and feature utilization

### ⚡ TL;DR

This is a two-week, NFT-gated cohort for training 10-30 participants to launch fully structured, fair-launch tokens using Goose.run and Maverick Protocol.

- Participants pay 0.1 ETH to mint a **soulbound NFT** (sold by Credexium)
- 75% of NFT revenue → Buy pressure for $GGG (Goose Guild Graduate Token)
  - Generates fees that benefit MAV stakers
  - Creates sustainable reward pool for participants
- 25% + creator rewards → Credexium ops funding
- Builders are trained on branding, deployment, lending, voting, and marketing using Goose
- Winners ranked by **market cap** + **fees generated**
- Graduates receive:
  - Badge NFTs
  - $GGG token rewards
  - Eligibility to lead future cohorts
- Top 5 performers receive additional $GGG token rewards
- Exclusive access to Goose Guild Graduate Group for program completers
